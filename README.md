<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

I started with the designs of the application, I then focused on implimenting the 3D functionality as this is one of the main features. I created the items and then finished off the application with the crafting functionality.
### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* Utilized and implemented `React` for a dynamic frontend web app.
Integration of `MUI` for UI.
* Using MONGO DB ATLASS for the backend server
* ThreeJs was used to include the #d functioinality.

### Challenges, Highlights & learnings

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you experienced with the project -->
Getting the 3D functionality working was quite a challenge, I struggled to find informative information, so a lot of experimentation was done.

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlights you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
When I managed to get the 3D functionality implimented, it really brought the project to life.
